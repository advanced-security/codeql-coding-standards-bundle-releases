# CodeQL Coding Standards Bundle

The CodeQL Coding Standards Bundle is a CodeQL bundle that includes the queries from the matching [CodeQL Coding Standards](https://github.com/github/codeql-coding-standards) project that is be open sourced in July 2022. More information on the CodeQL Coding Standards project can be found in [this](https://github.blog/2022-06-20-adding-support-for-coding-standards-autosar-c-and-cert-c/) blog post.

The queries implement the guidelines specified in the following standards targeting the projects using C++ revision [14](https://www.iso.org/standard/64029.html):
- [AUTOSAR - Guidelines for the use of C++14 language in critical and safety-related systems Release 18-10](https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/adaptive/18-10/AUTOSAR_RS_CPP14Guidelines.pdf)
- [MISRA C++:2008](https://www.misra.org.uk)
- [SEI CERT C++ Coding Standard: Rules for Developing Safe, Reliable, and Secure Systems (2016 Edition)](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetID=494932)

## How to use the bundle

The bundle can be use with the [Github CodeQL Action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action) by preceding the `github/codeql-action/init@v2` step with the following step:

```yaml
- name: Download CodeQL Coding Standards Bundle
  run: |
    gh release download -R advanced-security/codeql-coding-standards-bundle-releases v1.10.0 --pattern 'codeql-coding-standards.tar.gz'
```

The step initializing the Github CodeQL Action using `github/codeql-action/init@v2` can be instructed to use the bundle through the `tools` key and the queries can be specified through the `queries` key as follows:

```yaml
- name: CodeQL Initialize
  uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
  with:
    tools: codeql-coding-standards.tar.gz
    queries: autosar-default,cert-default
```

The CodeQL Coding Standards Bundle supports the following CodeQL query suites:

- `autosar-default`: All the supported AUTOSAR queries that are not audit queries.
- `autosar-required`: The AUTOSAR queries with obligation *required*, and that are not audit queries.
- `autosar-advisory`: The AUTOSAR queries with obligation *advisory*, and that are not audit queries.
- `autosar-audit`: The AUTOSAR queries that are audit queries. An audit query provides information that can aid in a manual review of a guideline with enforcement *non-automated*.
- `cert-default`: All the supported CERT queries.

## Troubleshooting

An elaborate user manual will be provided when the CodeQL Coding Standards is open sourced.
However the following errors might be troubleshooted if encountered.

### Error: Code Scanning could not process the submitted SARIF file

The error can occur using the action `github/codeql-action/analyze@v2` or `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2` that uploads the results of the CodeQL analysis with the following reason

`rejecting SARIF, as there are more results per run than allowed (25271 > 25000)`

This can occur when the CodeQL Coding Standard queries are used on a project that doesn't adhere to the standard resulting a one or more queries returning a large number of alerts.
The following steps can be used to troubleshoot the issue:

1. When using the `github/codeql-action/analyze@v2`, disable the automatic uploading of the SARIF file as follows:
   ```yaml
   - name: CodeQL Analyze
     uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
     with:
        upload: "false"
   ```
2. Upload the SARIF file with the `actions/` as follows:
   ```yaml
   - name: Upload SARIF
     uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
     with:
        name: results
        path: "../results"
   ```
3. Analyze the SARIF file in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) using the [SARIF Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-SarifVSCode.sarif-viewer) extension. The *rules* tab of the SARIF Viewer gives a breakdown per rule and the number of alerts.
4. Note down the rule id (of the form `cpp/autosar/...`) of the rules with a high number of alerts.
5. Revert the above changes to return to the regular workflow.
6. Create a CodeQL query suite that excludes the identified rule(s). More information on creating CodeQL query suites can be found at [Creating CodeQL query suites](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/creating-codeql-query-suites/). The following is an example for AUTOSAR that excludes the rule `cpp/autosar/undocumented-user-defined-type`:
   ```yaml
   - description: AUTOSAR C++14 Guidelines 19-11 (Customized)
   - import: codeql-suites/autosar-default.qls
     from: autosar-cpp-coding-standards
   - exclude:
     id:
        - cpp/autosar/undocumented-user-defined-type
   ```
7. Add the CodeQL query suite to the repository and refer to it in the `github/codeql-action/init@v2` step. The following example assumes the CodeQL query suite is stored at `.github/code-scanning/autosar.qls`:
   ```yaml
   - name: CodeQL Initialize
     uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
     with:
        tools: codeql-coding-standards.tar.gz
        queries: cert-default,.github/code-scanning/autosar.qls
